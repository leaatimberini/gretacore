# B3.61: Residual Stream Bisect Execution Report

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Commit**: `dc4b829`
**Author**: GRETA Release Engineering
**Status**: FAILED (Binary Memory Error)

## Objective

Execute residual stream bisect to identify first divergent tensor causing inference collapse at extended context lengths (~826 and ~1652 positions).

## Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Model** | TinyLlama 1.1B GGUF |
| **Model Path** | `/root/models/tinyllama/tinyllama.gguf` (symlinked to `models/greta-v1.gguf`) |
| **Tokenizer** | `/root/models/tinyllama/tokenizer.model` |
| **Binary** | `tools/inference/build/greta_infer` |
| **Target Layers** | 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 |
| **Prompts** | p0_short, p6_len_16, p6_len_32 |
| **Max Tokens** | 5 |

## Execution Summary

### Pre-Execution Sync
- **Local HEAD**: `dc4b829`
- **GitHub HEAD**: `dc4b829`
- **Remote MI300X HEAD**: `dc4b829`

### Model Validation
- ✅ TinyLlama model file exists: `/root/models/tinyllama/tinyllama.gguf` (668.8 MB)
- ✅ Tokenizer exists: `/root/models/tinyllama/tokenizer.model`
- ✅ Symlink created: `models/greta-v1.gguf` → `/root/models/tinyllama/tinyllama.gguf`

## Root Cause Analysis

**ERROR**: `RMSNorm (Attn) launch failed: an illegal memory access was encountered`

### Evidence

1. **Model Loading**: ✅ Weights loaded successfully from TinyLlama
2. **Layer Loading**: All 32 layers loaded (0/32, 8/32, 16/32, 24/32)
3. **Buffer Allocation**: Buffers allocated successfully
4. **Failure Point**: During RMSNorm kernel launch in Attention module

### Analysis

The binary `greta_infer` successfully:
- Initialized ROCm/HIP runtime
- Created scheduler for 32 layers
- Allocated GPU buffers
- Loaded TinyLlama weights (vocab size: 32000)

The failure occurs at the RMSNorm kernel launch, which is a GPU memory access error. This suggests:

1. **Memory Layout Mismatch**: The binary was likely compiled/linked against a specific memory layout that doesn't match TinyLlama's architecture
2. **Kernel Compatibility**: RMSNorm kernel may have hardcoded tensor dimensions or strides that don't match TinyLlama's hidden size (2048) or attention head configuration
3. **Architecture Difference**: TinyLlama 1.1B has different layer normalization parameters compared to greta-v1

## Conclusion

**B3.61 Execution**: FAILED ❌

### Reasons for Failure
- Binary `greta_infer` is incompatible with TinyLlama model
- The RMSNorm kernel cannot handle TinyLlama's memory layout
- Requires binary recompilation or kernel fix to support TinyLlama

### Artifacts
- Logs saved to: `artifacts_remote/2026-02-06/b3_61/run/`
- p0_short.log, p6_len_16.log, p6_len_32.log

### Next Steps
1. Rebuild binary with TinyLlama-compatible RMSNorm kernels
2. Or use greta-v1.gguf model (if available)
3. Re-execute B3.61 with working binary
