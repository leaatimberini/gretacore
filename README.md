# GRETA CORE

**Status**: Phase 3 - B3.xx Audit Series (Up to B3.60)

## Authorship & Leadership

**GRETA CORE** is an independent engineering project conceived, founded, and led by:

- **Leandro Emanuel Timberini**
  - Founder & Principal Systems Architect
  - All architectural decisions originate from this authorship
  - Long-term vision and foundational principles defined by the founder

---

## Project Description

GRETA CORE is a long-term engineering initiative focused on building a **high-performance, minimal, CUDA-like compute stack for AMD hardware**, designed specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs).

The project exists to break the current CUDA lock-in by addressing the problem at its root: **software**.

## Phase 3 Progress (B3.xx Audit Series)

| Milestone | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| B3.52 | ✅ PASS | KV cache addressing fix |
| B3.55-B3.58 | ✅ PASS | Root cause isolation (RoPE/Q-proj/RMSNorm) |
| B3.59 | ✅ PASS | Embedding + StageDebugInput audit |
| B3.60 | ✅ PASS | Attention Block bisect (Layer0 pipeline verified) |

**Documentation**:
- [Progress Index](docs/PROGRESS.md)
- [AMD Reports Index](docs/AMD/INDEX.md)

## Motivation

The modern AI ecosystem is dominated by a single compute platform. This dominance has created:

- Artificial barriers to entry
- Inflated hardware costs
- Limited innovation

GRETA CORE approaches this problem from a **software-first perspective**, aiming to unlock the full potential of AMD hardware through a focused, performance-driven compute stack.

---

## Philosophy

All principles originate from the founder's vision:

- **Software over hardware** - Control the stack, not just the silicon
- **Full stack control** - From kernel to inference
- **Minimalism over bloat** - Every line must justify its existence
- **Performance over abstraction** - Zero-cost abstractions only
- **Long-term engineering discipline** - Decades, not quarters

---

## What GRETA CORE Is

- A custom compute runtime for AMD hardware (MI300X, MI200, RDNA)
- A kernel-first LLM execution stack
- A CUDA-like developer experience without replicating CUDA
- A long-term research and engineering initiative
- An install that bundles torch, triton, and jax (no extra installs required)

---

## What GRETA CORE Is Not

- Not a CUDA fork
- Not a thin wrapper around existing frameworks
- Not a general-purpose GPU compute platform
- Not a short-term optimization project

## Contributing

This is a **long-term engineering initiative** led by the founder. All contributions must align with the project's philosophy of minimalism, performance, and full stack control.

**Focus areas**:
- Source code improvements
- Technical documentation
- Reproducible benchmarks
- Verifiable audits

**Non-acceptable changes**:
- Feature bloat
- Undocumented modifications
- Changes unrelated to the inference engine
